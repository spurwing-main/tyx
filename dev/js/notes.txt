updateTotalWidths
- updates values of totalWidth_closed and totalWidth_open
- called at start and on resize

generateBounds(expanded = false)
- if expanded, bounds defined by totalWidth_open
- if not expanded, bounds defined by totalWidth_closed

updateSnapPoints
- get left edge of each card, except last card which is going to be right edge
- limit by bounds
#Q - should snap points ever change except on resize? No EDIT - yes, there will be snap points for the expanded state, since the upper bound is higher
#Q - do we need to separate last card if we are already limiting by bounds? No

applyBounds
- just applies bounds to the drag instance
